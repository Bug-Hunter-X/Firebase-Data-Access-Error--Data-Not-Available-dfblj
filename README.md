This repository demonstrates a common Firebase error: attempting to access data before it's fully loaded.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, resulting in an error.  The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version using asynchronous programming and proper error handling to prevent this error.  The error is specifically when attempting to read data from Realtime Database before it's been fully populated.
